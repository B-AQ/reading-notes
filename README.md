# Growth Mindset #
A ** Growth Mindset ** is when people understand that their abilities can be developed, and it is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can grow through your efforts,so everyone can change and grow through application and experience, This is important because it can actually change what you pursue for and what you see as success. By changing the definition and the impact of failure.

## Ways to Develop a Growth Mindset ##
- Stop seeking approval
- Learn from other peopleâ€™s mistakes
- learn from criticism

like Dale Carnegie once said:
> Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed no hope at all.
