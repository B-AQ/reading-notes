# Charts

Are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

## Canvas

- The HTML ``<canvas>`` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
- The ``<canvas>`` element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
- Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
