## Images

- You can control the size of an image using the **width & height** properties in CSS
**Aligning Images using CSS**

Rather than using the ``<img>`` element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:

- The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
- New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
**Centering Images using CSS**

In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the displayproperty with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are ntwo common ways in which you can horizontally ncenter an image:-

1. On the containing element, you can use the text-alignproperty with a value of center.
1. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
**Background-image**

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

**Repeating Image**
background-repeat
background-attachment
``repeat-x`` The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
``repeat-y`` The image is repeated vertically only
``no-repeat`` The image is only shown once.
``fixed`` The background image stays in the same position on the page.
``scroll`` The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

**background-position**
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-positionproperty to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

**shorthand**
The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

**Image Rollovers & Sprites**
Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.
