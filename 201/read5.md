*Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)*

## Images

The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page.
You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

### Three Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format: Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif,
1. Save images at the right size: save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.
1. Use the correctresolution:Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.

## Color

You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

- **rgb values:** Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 
- **hex codes:** Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
- **color names:** Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
- **HSL Colors:** Hue,Saturation and lightness


*Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)*

## Text 

There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
