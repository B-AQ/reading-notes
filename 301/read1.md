# Component-Based Architecture

**What is a component?**

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

**What are the charactistics of a component?**

1. Reusability
1. Replaceable
1. Not context specific
1. Extensible
1. Encapsulated
1. Independent

**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development
- Reusable
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

# Props

**What is props short for?**
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another

**How are props used in React?**

1. Defining Attribute & Data
1. Passing Data using Props
1. Rendering Props Data

**What is the flow of props?**

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
